## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)

nhanes_small <- read_csv(here::here("data/nhanes_small.csv"))

```

You can add options to executable code like this 
```{r}
nhanes_small
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
